        description: "Thought challenging is a simple and effective Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) technique. Thought challenging isn’t about thinking positively in a negative situation. This technique will help you to consider things from multiple angles, using actual evidence from your life. It involves looking at the whole picture and weighing it up.\n\nThought challenging will help you consider things from a more objective perspective, rather than just assuming that your thoughts are the facts or “the truth” (even though some thoughts really do feel like they are facts!).\n\nIn short, thought challenging is an untangling technique, for the mind.\n\nNow the beauty with this approach is its simplicity. This technique involves asking yourself a series of questions that ultimately open up your thinking.",

        title: 'AWARE',
        description: '1. Acknowledge and Accept\n\nThe first step in the AWARE approach involves admitting that you are scared and possibly panicking. Do not attempt to convince yourself that your anxiety isn’t real or try to ignore it. Acknowledge and accept the presence of your anxiety and fear but remind yourself that you are not in any danger, despite what you may believe.\n\n2. Wait and Watch\n\nRather than attempting to distract yourself or reduce your anxiousness, don’t do anything except breathe. Deep breaths can decrease nausea and feelings of panic. Rather than jumping into another action, though, wait. Your anxiety attack is temporary and entering a fight-or-flight mode may cause additional anxiety because of your chosen action. “Watching” your anxiety attack involves being aware of how your anxiety attack operates. Some people fill out a diary or keep notes in their smartphone to track important characteristics of their attacks. Doing so can help you learn how to dull a panic attack when it begins.\n\n3. Actions\n\nDuring a panic attack, your role is to make yourself comfortable. The ways you can do this include deep breathing, think about the specifics of the anxiety attack, such as what caused it, write down the particulars of the anxiety attack, attempt to relax the areas of your body that are most affected by an anxiety attack, such as upset stomach or chest palpitations\n\n4. Repeat\n\nWhile anxiety attacks always end, they can occur again at any time. If one immediately happens after you complete these steps, repeat them. Anxiety attacks sometimes happen just seconds after one ended.\n\n5. End\n\nEvery anxiety attack ends. Remind yourself of that fact during the attack. Remembering that the panic is temporary can be soothing during a time of perceived crisis.',
