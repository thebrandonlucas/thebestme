      When something unpleasant happens in our life, our brain oftentimes has
      automatic negative thoughts. These automatic negative thoughts bring you
      down and exhaust you over time. Our thought challenging function is based
      off Cognitive Behavior Therapy, a common technique used by therapists.{'\n\n'} 
      It does exactly what it says: it challenges your negative thoughts and
      replaces them with more realistic, and oftentimes more positive and
      pleasant thoughts. This function, especially if used regularly, will ease
      that “brain fog,” that mental exhaustion that negative thoughts cause.
